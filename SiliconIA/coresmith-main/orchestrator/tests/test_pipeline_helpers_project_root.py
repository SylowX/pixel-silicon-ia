"""DV artifacts must be anchored to the RUN's project_root, not to the module
constant ``PROJECT_ROOT``.

In the daemon ``PROJECT_ROOT`` happens to equal the run dir (it is read from
``CORESMITH_PROJECT_ROOT``). In any process that does NOT set that env var --
tests, an operator's live-test script -- it resolves to the ENGINE CHECKOUT, so
``run_simulation`` built ``sim_build/`` and dropped ``tb/cocotb/`` wrappers into
the source tree (observed: a live-test run dirtied the checkout).

These tests keep the two roots DISTINCT (a "checkout" dir and a "run" dir) so
"landed under project_root" and "did not land under PROJECT_ROOT" are both
observable.
